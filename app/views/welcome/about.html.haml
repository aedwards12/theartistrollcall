    %p WhoDatIs helps you discover your favorite dancers and choreographers.

WhoDatIs was born after our founder, dancer/web developer Anthony Edwards, Jr., had experienced too many frustrating attempts to follow the dancers who inspired him. Say goodbye to scouring comment sections, tags, and endless social media posts in search of that dope dancer you saw with your favorite artist or online.

    %p If you’re a dancer or choreographer, WhoDatIs empowers you to connect with your fans, build your fan base, and get noticed. Whether you’re a fan, dancer, or choreographer, WhoDatIs helps you keep up with your faves and find inspiration. Fast. Never find yourself wondering, “Who dat is?” again!
